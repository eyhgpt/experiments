This repository showcases my explorations and findings on various topics, including Android app
development using AI, featuring experiments, techniques, and insights that I find useful and
intriguing.

# State Diagram To Code

![state_diagram](diagrams/state_diagram.png)

This article demonstrates how to model complex logic with Mermaid state diagrams and use LLMs to
generate Kotlin code and unit tests based on the diagrams, incorporating best practices such as
coroutines, dependency injection, and error handling in Android development.

# Packet Diagram To Code

[Packet Diagram To Code](PacketDiagramToCode.md)

This article demonstrates how to model network communication with Mermaid packet diagrams and use
LLMs to generate Kotlin code and JUnit tests for UDP packet structures, including checksum
calculation.

# Code to Entity Relationship Diagram, Entity Relationship Diagram To Code

[Code to Entity Relationship Diagram, Entity Relationship Diagram To Code](EntityRelationshipDiagramToCode.md)

This article demonstrates how to model complex data relationships by converting Kotlin code into
Mermaid ER diagrams and generating Kotlin code from Mermaid ER diagrams using LLMs, showcasing a
bidirectional workflow between code and visual documentation.

# Code To Mindmap

[Code To Mindmap](CodeToMindmap.md)

This article explores how to use LLMs to generate Mermaid mindmaps from source code, such as the
complex `SyncWorker` in the Now in Android app, to visualize relationships, dependencies, and
features for improved understanding and documentation.

# Use Unit Tests To Consolidate Knowledge

[Use Unit Tests To Consolidate Knowledge](UseUnitTestsToConsolidateKnowledge.md)

This article explores how writing unit tests can deepen understanding of Kotlin features like null
safety and experimental contracts, providing practical examples, insights into edge cases, and
safeguards for evolving language behaviors.
